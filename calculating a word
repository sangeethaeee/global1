#Write a program that calculates the count of words and spaces present in the file.
#The program should ask the user to provide the file path, read the file and give the following counts.
#The program should give the following counts:
#1. Total number of words
#2. Total number of duplicate words
#3. Total number of special characters
#4. Total number of spaces
#The program should handle any kind of error and give appropriate messages.
#The program should not use any external library to perform the task

ALGORITHM:
step-1:start
step-2:Define a file
step-3:Create one variable to hold the file path and initialize one variable to hold the total count of words and assumed it as 0
step-4:open the file in read only mode.Based on the number of words and number of spaces we can calculate total number of words
step-5:convert the string into string split form,to used to find duplicate words we may use two loops.outer lopp will select a word and initialize count to 1 similarly inner loop will compare the word selected by outer loop with rest of words
step-6:If a match found,then increment the count by 1 and set of duplicates of word to 0,on this we can find the rotal number of duplicate words
step-7:To find  the special characters we create a function count count_special_character which will count the occurance of special characters in a particular string.we create a variable special_char and initialize it to 0.This variable special_char is used as a counter,whenever there is an occurance of a special character this counter incremented by one
step-8:By reading file,we can find number of spaces
step-9:stop
